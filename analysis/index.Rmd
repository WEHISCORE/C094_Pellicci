# Overview

In this analysis, we study a dataset of human gamma-delta T cells collected by FACS gating on CD4 and CD161.

This dataset contains 1496 cells that were assayed on four 384-well plates using the CEL-Seq2 scRNA-seq platform.
Cells come from one of four mouse strains (ALB TPO, C57BL/6, Mpl, and Tmem68) and both male and female mice.

After sequencing, expression was quantified by counting the number of UMIs mapped to each gene using scPipe [@tian2018scpipe].
Count data for all endogenous genes (GENCODE Release vM18: GRCm38.p6) and spike-in transcripts (ERCC) are available in this repository.

This analysis is adapted from the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("simpleSingleCell")` workflow as well as the [**Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor book**](https://osca.bioconductor.org).
